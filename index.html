          This is an <b>unofficial draft</b> call for participation to an <b>unconfirmed</b> W3C Workshop on Bundling Interactive Media Content on the Web.
        </p>
        <section id="intro">
          <h2 id="goals">
            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together browser vendors, content owners, encoding and authoring tool makers, distributors and distribution enablers, experts in media standards and other relevant areas (e.g. accessibility, scripting, security, web) <b>to converge on technologies for bundling and playback of interactive media content on the Open Web Platform for offline distribution and in streaming scenarios</b>, and extend the platform with additional technologies when needed.</p>

          <p>We won't just be listening to presentations. We will be actively participating in breakout sessions and working discussions covering <a href="#topics">topics identified as relevant to the participants</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id="topics">
            Which topics will be covered?
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>How to bundle audio/video content with non-media content and user interactions for <b>offline distribution</b>? For instance, how to make a classic DVD-like experience, with navigation, ancillary content, encapsulating and aiding presentation and navigation of a movie?</li>
            <li>Can a similar solution be used to bundle content for <b>distribution from edge cache servers</b> in a way that preserves Web security guarantees (based on the notion of <em>origin</em>)?</li>
            <li>How to <b>orchestrate synchronized playback</b> of media and non-media content, and <b>guarantee consistent user experiences (UX)</b> across devices? For example, how to make a tutorial-like experience, where a lecture is presented, in context, in a web experience, with slides and diagrams delivered using web technologies but synchronized to the video?</li>
            <li>More generally, how to manage the <b>insertion and overlay of ancillary and interstitial content</b>, including but not limited to advertisements, logo overlays, explanatory overlays, and the like?</li>
            <li>How to ensure that content may start playing as soon as possible? In other words, what mechanisms can help make such experiences <b>streamable</b>, including starting playback from an arbitrary position and only fetching resources necessary for rendering at the current user position in the experience?</li>
            <li>Are there specific bundling requirements for <b><abbr title="Virtual reality / Augmented reality">XR experiences</abbr></b>?</li>
            <li>What <b>synergies</b> exist between bundling of interactive media content and bundling of other types of content?</li>
            <li>What mechanisms may allow <b>integration of monetization schemes</b> in a bundled experience?</li>
            <li class="todo">TBD</li>
          </ul>

            How can I attend?
          </h2>
          <p>Attendance is <b>free</b> for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members.</p>
          <p>If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the <span class="todo">registration form (TBD)</span>. We want to fill the room with people with practical experience with authoring and distributing games, and with people involved in relevant Web technologies and their standardization.</p>
          <p>Because the venue can only accommodate so many people, you must receive an acceptance email in order to attend. Also, be sure to keep an eye on <a href="#dates">these important dates</a>.</p>
          <p>On top of registration, we encourage you to suggest a specific topic for discussion at the workshop by submitting a <a href="#position-statement">position statement</a>.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to get a diversity of attendees from a variety of industries and communities, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Technology groups</li>
            <li>Experts in verticals and delivery</li>
            <li>Content owners and enabling technology providers (encoding and authoring tool makers)</li>
            <li>Distributors and distribution enablers (e.g. CDNs)</li>
            <li>Media devices manufacturers (TV sets, VR/AR headsets)</li>
            <li>Browser vendors</li>
            <li>Experts in relevant technologies (accessibility, media, scripting, security, web)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This workshop, as other W3C meetings, operates under its <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 id="position-statement">
            How can I suggest a presentation?
          </h2>

          <p>This is a workshop, not a conference. Presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.</p>

          <p>In order to facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.</p>

          <p>If you wish to present on a topic, you can send a position statement to the Program Committee at <span class="todo">&lt;TBD&gt;</span> by the deadline (see <a href="#dates">important dates</a>). Our <a href="#committee">program committee</a> will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.</p>

          <p>A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your background on games and/or Web technologies;</li>
            <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on;</li>
            <li>Links to related supporting resources;</li>
            <li>Optionally, other topics you think the workshop should cover.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text format. Images should be included inline in HTML using base64-encoded data URIs. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The position statement and the input provided at registration time (e.g. bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.</p>

            What is W3C?
          </h2>
          <p>
            W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
            communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
            and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
            for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
            technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
            ‚Äúontology‚Äù) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
            our members and our community.
